# ErgoQuest Controller

## About ErgoQuest
ErgoQuest is a company that builds zero-gravity workstations for people with back issues and other physical disabilities, allowing them to continue working with minimal pain. ErgoQuest builds both chairs and workstations for their clients. 

## The Problem
Currently, ErgoQuest's chairs are controlled either using simple switches for each motor in the chair, or using an app. The switches have limited functionality, and cannot be programmed for setting preset positions. The app has buttons for manual control and preset functionality, but the user interface leaves much to be desired, and there are missing features.  These clients need to reposition their body periodically to avoid bed sores and circulation issues. Currently, they have to remember to either manually adjust the chair with the switches, or select the different presets on the app. There is only one competitor, the original app that is still in use today. Our goal is to create a more userfriendly design that can function better than the original app with the added capability of creating an account and storing presets.

## The Solution
We will design a new app for ErgoQuest to control their zero-gravity chairs. This app will include all the features from the old app (manual chair controls, preset positions, BlueTooth connection to the chair's motors, and the ability to customize the names of motors). The new app will include an improved user interface that is appealing and easy to use for those with disabilities. A major new functionality will be the ability to set the chair to automatically switch between selectable, preset positions at custom time intervals.
